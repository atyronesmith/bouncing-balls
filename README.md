## üé® Vibe Coding Philosophy

This project exemplifies **"vibe coding"** - a development approach that prioritizes:

### üåä Flow State Development
- **Iterative Enhancement**: Features evolved organically through conversation
- **Creative Exploration**: Started as simple bouncing balls, transformed into space simulation
- **Intuitive Design**: Each addition felt natural and enhanced the overall experience
- **Emergent Complexity**: Sophisticated systems arose from simple interactions

### ü§ù Collaborative Creation
- **Human-AI Partnership**: Ideas flowed between human creativity and AI implementation
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate testing and refinement of each feature

## üéÆ Gameplay Experience

The simulator creates an immersive space travel experience where you navigate through a realistic galaxy populated by watchful eyeball entities. Your dragon companion intelligently protects you by predicting your movement and clearing threats from your path. The stellar background provides authentic astronomical ambiance with proper star classifications and parallax effects.

Strategic elements include:
- **Bullet Herding**: Use repulsion shots to guide eyeballs away
- **Dragon Coordination**: Move predictably to help your protector
- **Safe Positioning**: Respawn system gives you breathing room
- **Visual Tracking**: Eyeballs watch your every move with realistic iris movement

## üî¨ Physics & Algorithms

### Collision Detection
- Circular collision detection with radius-based overlap
- Mass-based separation using momentum conservation
- Elastic collision response with energy damping

### Stellar Distribution
```go
// Galactic density function
density = baseRate * exp(-distanceFromCenter/scaleLength)
// Spiral arm enhancement
spiralBonus = 1 + spiralStrength * cos(spiralPhase)
```

### Strategic AI
- Grid-based pathfinding for optimal respawn locations
- Velocity prediction for dragon interception
- Threat assessment using distance and velocity vectors
